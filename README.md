Certainly! Let's break down the JavaScript function missingNumber(nums) step by step:

* const numSet = new Set(nums);: This line creates a Set called numSet using the array nums as input. A Set is a data structure that stores unique values, so any duplicate values in the nums array will be removed.

* const n = nums.length;: This line stores the length of the nums array in the variable n, representing the total number of elements in the array.

* for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {: This line starts a for loop that iterates from 0 up to n, inclusive. It will check each number from 0 to n to see if it is present in the nums array.

* if (!numSet.has(i)) {: This line checks if the current value of i is not present in the numSet Set. numSet.has(i) returns true if i is present in numSet and false otherwise. The ! operator negates this result, so !numSet.has(i) evaluates to true if i is not in the Set.

* return i;: This line returns the current value of i as the missing number if i is not found in the numSet Set.

So, the function iterates through numbers from 0 to n, checks if each number is present in the nums array using the numSet Set, and returns the first number that is missing from the array.
